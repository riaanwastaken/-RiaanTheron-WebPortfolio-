      <b>a Short intro about myself - </b>Hi! Thanks for visiting my page!
      My name is Riaan, and I grew up in the small town south of South Africa, called Hermanus.
      After Highschool I completed my Diploma in Civil Engineering, with a post graduate degree in Construction Management.
      After that, I spent a few years working for a construction company throughout South Africa.

        <h2>My work experience</h2>
        <p>
        From shoveling dirt in the trenches, designing pipe fittings to attending monthly cost meetings - 
        I have been blessed with the opportunity to explore Civil Engineering Construction from all aspects over the past 10 Years. 
        What the past 10 years have taught me is that as soon as you think you know everything, 
        you soon find yourself in a situation you have never encountered before. 
        <br>
        <br>
        It is this endless learning aspect in Civil Engineering that I enjoyed.

        <p class="moreButton">"The Only Constant in Life is Change".</p>
        <p>
          While I have a background in the construction industry, I am passionate 
          about leveraging programming to develop innovative solutions that streamline 
          and automate complex human problems. Therefore, I decided to explore this 
          industry and expand my skill set by taking a new direction towards technology. 
          I am excited to learn new things and bridge the gap between my past experiences 
          and my future goals.
